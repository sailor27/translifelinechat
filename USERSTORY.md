## Trans Lifeline Call Metrics:
source : Trans Lifeline Volunteer and Intern Call Training
* Self-care
* Building community
* Helping the caller make progress, hold ground, &/or be resilient (action) in any active step of self-care or community-building, no matter how small

## Call Flow:
source:  Trans Lifeline Volunteer and Intern Call Training
1. Build trust, connection & rapport as the call begins
2. Ask relevant, probing, open-ended questions. Listen empathetically.
3. Explore relevant options & resources (databases and other resource guides)
4. Validate strengths. Empower callers to act on relevant options they want to explore. (Use harm reduction approach & recognize stages of change a caller might be experiencing.)
5. Wrap up the call.
[Immediately after each call, post a brief call note on our Dashboard.]

## Call Categories:
source : Trans Lifeline Volunteer and Intern Call Training
1. Calls just to chat: Crisis prevention through combating social isolation, building community.  
2. Resource calls: Connecting people in very practical ways when a caller asks help finding trans-safe resources but not yet in crisis (another form of crisis prevention)
Later we’ll introduce our Resource database (Rad Remedy) & how to crowdsource within Trans Lifeline during a call.
3. Coming out & transition calls (mixed intervention / prevention): To support callers as they weigh decisions related to these topics, use active listening.
Use good self-care and personal boundaries while sharing experience, to help normalize (rather than stigmatize or pathologize) trans lived experiences. Use “I” language without universalizing / generalizing your own personal experiences (peer to peer support).
4. Severe but not immediately life-threatening crisis: NO ACTIVE RESCUE; our goals & strategies instead are triage, de-escalation, & safety planning: “Where can you go? What can you do now to get safe?”
5. Caller is actively in immediate danger, such as having swallowed a bottle of pills for example.
If you need support on an emergency call, use our Emergency Call Procedures: Alert the Dashboard Manager, your Team Lead, &/or the Hotline Program Director immediately. NEVER HANG UP ON A CALLER (unless it’s a prank call): If you are triggered/past capacity, please alert the Dashboard Manager or Hotline Program Director to take over the call.
We do not do active rescue & never push a caller to seek outside help, but if a caller asks your help to contact an outside agency and the caller gets care from that agency for some calls, add the note “IC” (“informed consent”): “Informed consent" is when caller initiates this request (we NEVER do), for example “Could you please call paramedics for me?”) This happens once every month or two (not per operator but at Trans Lifeline as a whole.)

**Most Trans Lifeline calls are crisis prevention (categories 1 - 3). 80% of Trans lifeline calls are categories 1 and 2.**
