# **Trans Lifeline Web Chat** ‚òéÔ∏è

## Project Description
Trans Lifeline is a non-profit hotline for transgender people experiencing crisis. It is staffed by transgender volunteer operators. Their mission is to end transgender suicide and improve overall mental health of transgender people through education, advocacy, and direct service.

The purpose of this application is to create a live chat mode of talking with a Trans Lifeline volunteer operator, an alternative to a voice phone call. The application expresses a user story for a person seeking crisis support using chat, and a user story for a volunteer operator connecting to people in the queue, chatting, and creating case notes.

### MVP:
**Session:**
* Messages for a single chat session are rendered in chat window
* Messages are time-stamped and attached to operator or chatter
* Operator and chatter‚Äôs messages are distinguishable from eachother and appear in chronological order

**Operator:**
* Can see sessions to start with time requested
* Can initiate session with chatter
* Can type message and send, and see message in window
* Can see messages sent to window by chatter
* Can compose notes for chat session
* Can end session
* Has state of : isConnected or !isConnected

**Chatter:**
* Can see chat how to before starting
* Can place a chat for operator to answer
* Can see when they are connected with an operator
* Can end session
* Caller can see when they are connected with an operator
* Can type message and send, and see message in window
* Chatter can tell that the operator is listening
